21 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
22 Section 1. Section 20A-19-103 is amended to read:
23 20A-19-103. Redistricting standards and requirements.
24 (1) As used in this section:
25 (a) "Ensemble analysis" meansan analysis of a proposed redistricting plan:
26 {(i) {an analysis that:} }
27 {(A)}(i) that uses a sequential Monte Carlo simulation to generate an ensemble of at least 4,000
redistricting plans before culling any plan for compliance with this section; {and}
29 {(B)}(ii) that indicates whether a proposed redistricting plan shows a partisan intent by comparing the
{plan to the ensemble described in Subsection (1)(a)(i)(A) to measure if the proposed redistricting
} proposed plan{, using the partisan index and based on squared deviations, falls outside the
normal distribution of } to the {expected outcomes that the ensemble establishes; and} ensemble by
calculating:
30 (A) the ranked marginal deviation of the ensemble by:
31 (I) identifying one of the two major political parties as the reference party;
32 (II) for each map the simulation generates, ranking the districts from worst performance for the
reference party to best performance for the reference party, using the partisan index;
35 (III) at each rank, calculating the average vote share for the reference party;
36 (IV) for each map the simulation generates, calculating the deviations between the reference party's
performance at each rank and the average vote share at that rank;
39 (V) squaring the deviations described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(IV);
40 (VI) adding together the squared deviations described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(V) for each map;
42 (VII) dividing the sum described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(VI) by the number of districts; and
44 (VIII) taking the square root of the quotient described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(VII); and
46 (B) the ranked marginal deviation of the proposed redistricting plan by:
47 (I) ranking the districts from worst performance for the reference party to best performance for the
reference party, using the partisan index;

(II) calculating the deviations between the reference party's performance at each rank and the average
vote share described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(IV);
52 (III) squaring the deviations described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B)(II);
53 (IV) adding together the squared deviations described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B)(III);
55 (V) dividing the sum described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B)(IV) by the number of districts; and
57 (VI) taking the square root of the quotient described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B)(V); and
59 (iii) for which the following results fail the ensemble analysis:
34 {(ii)}(A) {for which } a result described in Subsection {(1)(a)(i) } (1)(a)(ii)(B)(VI) that is {not within
2.5} greater than the result described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(VIII) of 95% {and 97.5% fails } of
the ensemble {analysis.} districts; or
62 (B) a result described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B)(VI) that is greater than the result described in
Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(A)(VIII) of 95% of the ensemble districts after culling the ensemble to include
only redistricting plans that pass the partisan bias test, as described in Subsection (1)(c)(ii).
36 (b) "Mean-median difference test" means an evaluation of a proposed redistricting plan:
37 (i) that calculates the difference between a party's average statewide vote share and the party's median
vote share across all districts in a proposed redistricting plan;and
39 {(ii) {for which the difference between the average and median percentages described in Subsection (1)
(b)(i) reflects:} }
41 {(A) {the degree of partisan asymmetry;} }
42 {(B) {asymmetry in favor of a party with a median district vote share percentage above 50%; and} }
44 {(C) {asymmetry against a party with a median district vote share percentage below 50%; and} }
46 {(iii)}(ii) for which a difference described in Subsection {(1)(b)(ii) } (1)(b)(i) that is greater than a 2%
deviation from the mean fails the mean-median difference test.
48 (c) "Measures of partisan symmetry" means, for a congressional redistricting plan:
49 (i) the partisan bias test; and
50 (ii) an ensemble analysis with subsequent culling to include only redistricting plans that pass the
partisan bias test to ensure the plan is within the statistical bounds of passing plans.
53 (d) "Partisan bias test" means an evaluation of partisan symmetry in a proposed redistricting plan:
55 (i) that follows the following sequential steps:
56 (A) calculate each party's statewide vote share using the partisan index;
57 (B) calculate the difference between each party's statewide vote share and 50%;

SB1011 compared with SB1011S01
58 (C) subtract the difference described in Subsection (1)(d)(i)(B) from each party's vote share in each
district in the proposed redistricting plan based on the partisan index data for each census block
within the district; and
61 (D) based on the adjusted vote share described in Subsection (1)(d)(i)(C), calculate the difference
between each party's expected seat share and 50% of the total seats in a hypothetical election, with
the difference between the party's seat share in the hypothetical election and 50% of the total seats
representing the degree of partisan bias; and
66 (ii) for which a result described in Subsection (1)(d)(i) other than the following fails the partisan bias
test:
68 (A) for an even number of seats, 0; or
69 (B) for an odd number of seats, 0.5.
70 (e) "Partisan index" means an average of the partisan vote share:
71 (i) except as provided in Subsection (1)(e)(ii), in the three immediately preceding statewide elections
for each of the following offices:
73 (A) United States president;
74 (B) governor;
75 (C) attorney general;
76 (D) state treasurer; and
77 (E) state auditor;
78 (ii) except as provided in Subsection (1)(e)(iii), that excludes an election for an office in which the two
largest political parties did not field a candidate; and
80 (iii) that allocates votes for an independent general election candidate to a political party if the
independent candidate attempted to win the nomination of the political party at a primary election or
party convention for the same general election.
107 (f) "Sequential Monte Carlo simulation" means a probabilistic algorithm that simultaneously generates
a representative ensemble of districting plans for comparison in an ensemble analysis by building
redistricting plans through a step-by-step random sampling method, weighting and resampling the
plans to reflect legal and geometric criteria.
83 {(f)}(g) "Unduly favor or disfavor" in regards to Subsection (4) for purposes of a congressional map,
means the map is asymmetrical under the measures of partisan symmetry and fails the mean-median
difference test.

greatest extent practicable and in the following order of priority:
90 (a) adhering to the Constitution of the United States and federal laws, such as the Voting Rights Act,
52 U.S.C. Secs. 10101 through 10702, including, to the extent required, achieving equal population
among districts using the most recent national decennial enumeration made by the authority of the
United States;
94 (b) minimizing the division of municipalities and counties across multiple districts, giving first priority
to minimizing the division of municipalities and second priority to minimizing the division of
counties;
97 (c) creating districts that are geographically compact;
98 (d) creating districts that are contiguous and that allow for the ease of transportation throughout the
district;
100 (e) preserving traditional neighborhoods and local communities of interest;
101 (f) following natural and geographic features, boundaries, and barriers; and
102 (g) maximizing boundary agreement among different types of districts.
103 [(3)] (4)
(a) The Legislature and the Commission may not divide districts in a manner that purposefully or
unduly favors or disfavors any incumbent elected official, candidate or prospective candidate for
elective office, or any political party.
106 (b) Absent clear and convincing evidence of purpose, a redistricting plan that is within the acceptable
bounds of the ensemble analysis does not purposefully favor or disfavor a political party under
Subsection (4)(a).
109 (c) A redistricting plan that is symmetrical under the measures of partisan symmetry and passes the
mean-median difference test does not unduly favor or disfavor a political party under Subsection (4)
(a).
112 [(4)] (5) The Legislature and the Commission shall use judicial standards and the best available data
and scientific and statistical methods, including measures of partisan symmetry, to assess whether
a proposed redistricting plan abides by and conforms to the redistricting standards contained in this
[Section] section, including the restrictions contained in Subsection [(3)] (4).
