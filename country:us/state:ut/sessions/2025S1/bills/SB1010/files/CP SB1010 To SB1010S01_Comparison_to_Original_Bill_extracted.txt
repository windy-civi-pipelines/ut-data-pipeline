Constitution, or a similar claim under Utah Constitution, Article I, Sec. 12 and Sec. 14[, Utah
Constitution].
8226 (b) A party subpoenaed under this chapter shall be advised by the subpoena that the party has a right

subpoena or of the information sought or of the existence of the investigation under which it is
issued would pose a threat of harm to a person or otherwise impede the investigation, the subpoena
- 255 -
SB1010 compared with SB1010S01
shall contain language on its face directing that the witness not disclose to any person the existence
or service of the subpoena, the information being sought, or the existence of an investigation.
8250 Section 83. Section 77-22b-1 is amended to read:
8251 77-22b-1. (Effective 11/06/25)Immunity granted to witness.
8252 (1)
(a) A witness who refuses, or is likely to refuse, on the basis of the witness's privilege against self-
incrimination to testify or provide evidence or information in a criminal investigation, including a
grand jury investigation or prosecution of a criminal case, or in aid of an investigation or inquiry
being conducted by a government agency or commission, or by either house of the Legislature,
a joint committee of the two houses, or a committee or subcommittee of either house, may be
compelled to testify or provide evidence or information by any of the following, after being granted
use immunity with regards to the compelled testimony or production of evidence or information:
8261 (i) the attorney general or any assistant attorney general authorized by the attorney general;
8263 (ii) a district attorney or any deputy district attorney authorized by a district attorney;

evidence or information under a grant of use immunity, the prosecutor shall notify the witness by
written notice.

8278 (A) shall include the information contained in Subsection (2);
8279 (B) [and] shall advise the witness that the witness may not refuse to testify or provide evidence or
information on the basis of the witness's privilege against self-incrimination[.] ; and
- 256 -

witness in any criminal or quasi-criminal case, nor any information directly or indirectly derived

volunteered by the witness or is otherwise not responsive to a question. Immunity does not extend
to prosecution or punishment for perjury or to giving a false statement in connection with any
testimony.
8291 (3)
(a) If a witness is granted immunity under Subsection (1) and is later prosecuted for an offense that
was part of the transaction or events about which the witness was compelled to testify or produce
evidence or information under a grant of immunity, the burden is on the prosecution to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that no use or derivative use was made of the compelled testimony,
evidence, or information in the subsequent case against the witness, and to show that any proffered
evidence was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled testimony, evidence, or
information.
8299 (b) The remedy for not establishing that any proffered evidence was derived from sources totally
independent of the compelled testimony, evidence, or information is suppression of that evidence
only.
